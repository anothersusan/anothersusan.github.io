  <div class="section">
    <p>I have been in the IT world forever, but on the design side. That's my comfort zone. Now I'm teaming up with <a href="http://studio6thave.com/"; target="_blank">Brenda Long</a> to teach the FEWDD Bootcamp (Front End Web Design & Development) at Nashville Software School so I have thrown myself into this class to learn the "NSS ways" AND to experience the some of the pain my students are going to go through. 
    </p>
    <p>Stay tuned to see how this works out.... </p>

    <h2>My Resume </h2>
    <p>My resume is crazy long so I am going to send you to my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanculkin/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> page. You can decided if it's worth reading the whole thing. But here are some key summary points:
      <ul>
        <li>I'm an instructor at NSS because the user's experience IS part of the software development life cycle. Why build something no one would use? or buy!?!</li>
        <li>I have been freelancing for 6 years after many different jobs (again, go <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanculkin/" target="_blank">here</a> for more on that).  </li>
        <li>Industries I have crafted user experiences for: healthcare, law, finance, security, intelligence, music, cable, higher education... I know there's more but that's all that comes to mind right now. </li>
        <li>People often ask what my favorite projects are: Putting the first complete cable TV app on an iPad was awesome. Online medical triage app was a fabulous challenge. I hate dashboards because they are over used and clich√© but I designed some for intel analysts that quickly made a real, measurable difference in their work after we launched. </li>
        <li>PREACH: User Experience (UX) is not the UI, but the UI is part of the UX. </li>
      </ul>

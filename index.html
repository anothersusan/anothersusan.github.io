        <h1>I am in NSS Cohort 22</h1>
        <h2>How on earth did I get here?</h2>
          <p>
        Hi. I'm Susan. I have been in the IT world forever, but on the design side. That's my comfort zone. Now I'm teaming up with Brenda Long to teach the FEWDD Bootcamp (Front End Web Design & Development) at NSS so I have thrown myself into this class to learn the "NSS ways" AND to experience the same pain my students are going to go through. Stay tuned. We'll see how this works out....

       <h3> My Resume</h3>
         <p>
        My resume is crazy long so I am going to send you to my <a href https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanculkin/>LinkedIn</a> page to read the whole thing. But here are some key points:
        <ul>
            <li>I'm an instructor at NSS because the user's experience IS part of the sofware development life cycle. Why build something no one would use?</li>
            <li>I have been freelancing for 6 years after many different jobs </li>
        </ul>
         
    </p>
